## Reflection
**HTTP Request/Response**
An HTTP request refers to what the browser sends to the server such as the webpage(feedback) 
An HTTP response refers to the reply from the server which conttains the requested content like status code.

**Status code**
The status code was (200k ok), this means that the request was successful and the resources were delivered in a correct way.
